# Amazon Simple Notification Service

Fully managed pub/sub messaging for microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, 
fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, 
and serverless applications. 
Amazon SNS provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. 
Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fan out messages to a large number of subscriber 
endpoints for parallel processing, including Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP/S webhooks. 
Additionally, SNS can be used to fan out notifications to end users using mobile push, SMS, and email.

You can get started with Amazon SNS in minutes by using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS Software Development Kit (SDK).
